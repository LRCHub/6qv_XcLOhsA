I made it here with endurance
Nicotine with no insurance
I'm mixing molly and liquor for social events
It's the only way through it
I overthink, it's a hobby
I never learned how to copy
Being yourself isn't all that you thought
Niggas gon' still put yo' ass in a box
What the fuck rap? They love singing and crooning
Most of these hoes is just rapping and mooning
Way that we rockin' we had to confuse 'em
Dbz look at the way that we fusin'
Rap with the rock, this the fuck how you do it
Pussy-ass nigga, you going out stupid
We going up and I know that you hate it
After this year, don't you ever debate it
Bitch
Momma just saw me on stage
Doing my dance and she love it
Father been poppin' that oxy for pain
He tryna fix shit 'fore it's over
My heart is really in London
I went back home to a woman who needed me
Just to tell her that it's over
I never had this attention
I had to still get adjusted
Used to get jackets from Justin
Used to be dirty and dusty
Shawty five one and she busty
Shawty five one and she fussy
My children around so no cussing
I'm in the cut where it's pussing
Lighten up the mood with the incense
I can see the moon in the distance
I gave niggas art with the first tape
But I was missin' out on money makin' real shit (real shit)
New niggas say they want the old Ken
The Ken that they don't spin?
Went to war with a star 'cause a nigga tried to clone Ken
Came up with the style, niggas say I tried to clone them?
Cool, when yo' check hit we both split it
A lot of y'all critics just some gold diggers
How can I respect any opinions
When I seen you give respect to some ho niggas?
I wrestled with the industry and folded it
In a figure four now I'm a known figure
Shawty got figure like Yoncé from Goldmember
Her goals aligned with these gold dentures
Too hood for the art shit
Too smart for the hard shit
Too depressed to be a narcissist
I just know my shit better than y'all shit
They gon' try to say a nigga a rock rap, like it's not rap
Guess that mean it don't count when they get out rapped
Sayin' it ain't rock on a rock track
Guessing when you Black, it's all trap
I was tryna solve all the family shit
Same time gettin' robbed by my management
Same time arguing wit' shawty gettin' mad and shit
Drinking all the time tryna handle it
No more rapping 'bout the shit that I done been through
'Cause when I run into a fan I feel seen through
Feel like I gotta die to get the love like I need to
Can't miss someone 'til they leave you
R.I.P. Peep, R.I.P. Juice
R.I.P. sleep, I'm tryna see it through
Working tape, gotta see it through
Niggaa finishing the album, gotta see it through
R.I.P. Lito, R.I.P. Phew
Please watch over yo' dad 'cause he need you
Wish I could do it but I can't, gotta see it through
Niggas finishing the tape, gotta see it through
Yo, there's a tumor in my gums
Met my sister at the dentist just to see if he could drain it out
I still gotta go back to get it taken out
I think he was sayin' somethin''bout root canals
I don't know why it hasn't given me trouble yet
Maybe 'cause of how often a nigga spittin' now
Hopefully, by the time you hear this it's taken out
But anyway, it's more important shit to frown about
I got a sister who illness stressin' my momma out
And I still gotta hear the bullshit y'all talk about
Mhm, mhm, uh-huh, mhm, okay
It sound dumb but I'ma let you do it anyway
You hard-headed, need to learn from fallin' on your face
Mo' money mo' problems, well, if that's the case
I'm gettin' bank, more notes than a Opera House
What you think that say about the state my mind in now?
I could always say that I tried
You would claim it wasn't my best
I could spend my whole life on this shit
And I still wouldn't feel in debt
(Hey) don't forget
When I'm on the mic, yeah, it's war in my pen
Food for thought, here's something more to digest (hey)
For dessert, they might that that eagle soar from the nest
