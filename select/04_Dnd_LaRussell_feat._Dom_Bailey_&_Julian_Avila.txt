I should of known better
I wasn't ready for you
We was lost in the sauce
I made spaghetti for you

I see my wrongs now
I see my rights too
I see the rosebud
I see the spikes too

I'll try to keep it short
You love a haiku
Not tryna hold you down
I just wanna fly too

Just tryna grow too
I wanna let go too
You tryna know yaself
I wanna know too

I wanna find peace
I wanna live well
If I wasn't made for this
I would of been failed

I would of been quit
Never would win shit
Year of the dragonfly
I'm spiraling ah shit

I can't shed no tears for you
I was gone but I was here you
Sacrificed some years for you

Please don't hit my line I'm on DND
All of the great shit you ain't see me
Turned me to the man that I need to be
Don't hit my line I'm on DND
