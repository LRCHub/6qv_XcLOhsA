In my eyes you can see jewels
Laging play safe, naka flight mode, with the goons
Ain't nothin' new
Pirma sa check no adidas
Remember when they ain't believe us?

Talk your shit while me see this get this money baby
Buhay ko ay parang palabas
Codeine crazy on repeat
Nasa highway, yung takbo one hundred and eighty
Yung vibes alam mo balagbag oh yeah
She love my style oh yeah
Purple and sprite for the night, flashing lights oh yeah
Said we outside oh yeah
Ice in my veins, walang techfleece
The ting go pop, hindi pepsi
Flexy, sa balikat that's fendi
'Di malandi, just friendly, get me?
Flow so sexy
Iwan ka pag ako nag hesi
Yoko nang messy
Tablado ka saken kapag galawan mo sketchy
Pwede mo testing
Basta ko ay unli yung blessings
Basta ko ay unli yung blessings
