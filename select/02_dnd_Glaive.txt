I think this might be the end of everything
One shot, two lost and a wedding ring
Speak now or hold your peace, I ain't say a thing
Wish I would've 'cause, baby, you're my- (fuck, nah)
Starting to think that this is only the beginning
My brain is going too fast, a mile a minute
Live grenade in my hand, somehow I managed to pin it
She don't like her friends, yeah, she's just trying to fit in
Run, run, run, baby, I think things might get a little dicey
And I don't really care about your friends and if they like me
The doctor said I'm fucked up and I think that he's right
'Cause everyone gaslights me (fuck)
Put my phone on DND 'cause I don't want nobody to call
I don't wanna see all your texts, I don't wanna see you at all
I got a BNB two miles away from the mall
Nobody gettin' in 'cause I don't care about y'all (fuck)
Put my phone on DND 'cause I don't want nobody to call
I don't wanna see all your texts, I don't wanna see you at all
I got a BNB two miles away from the mall
Nobody gettin' in 'cause I don't care about y'all
And that chip on your shoulder
Doesn't matter, we're older
I keep my friends in a folder
Doesn't matter, we're over
And the worlds on fire
At least that's what I told her
And, I'm sorry for the wait
I'm just mulling it over
It's a pity how like everything turned out
It was going so well until you opened your damn mouth
And you fucked us up so bad and like that's without a doubt
And there's still one little thing that my brain can't figure out
How you lie to me so constantly? But I don't really care
Fuck with my brain like lobotomy 'cause you were never there
I think I'll die soon probably so I'll be out your hair
And mama always told me life is never ever fair (fuck)
Put my phone on DND 'cause I don't want nobody to call
I don't wanna see all your texts, I don't wanna see you at all
I got a BNB two miles away from the mall
Nobody gettin' in 'cause I don't care about y'all (fuck)
Put my phone on DND 'cause I don't want nobody to call
I don't wanna see all your texts, I don't wanna see you at all
I got a BNB two miles away from the mall
Nobody gettin' in 'cause I don't care about y'all
